Leet Code Problem 20

The Time Complexity for this problem is Big O(n)
  - This is because we only go through our string s, at most one time looking at every character
 
The space complexity for this problem is also Big O(n)
  - This is because we must store characters of a string in a stack(list) of up to n characters
